# About

Creating an app where CuperTinoTabBar controls PageView. This approach provides a seamless
navigation experience for users, allowing them to swipe between different views (or not;
learn how to block users from swiping as well).

## Final result

![Result_1_](https://github.com/swapnilpaliwal-sd/navigation_bar_start/assets/78632212/c1d34b9f-1eab-4c4c-90ef-4d753cc164bd) ![Result_2_](https://github.com/swapnilpaliwal-sd/navigation_bar_start/assets/78632212/1863b21b-1414-4482-be8d-fbe8640eb7fa)

## Setup

This is the starting point of the project. The video covers the complete implementation.
The project currently contains font family and icons that will be used in the project.

## Introduction

Learn how to create stunning navigation for an app using custom icons and fonts and navigate
beautifully across different pages in style. This project will help you take your flutter game
to the next level.

This project serves as an excellent starting point for controlling PageView with CupertinoTabBar,
complete with custom icons.

Custom icons and fonts are included to enhance the app's visual aesthetics.
These unique elements add a personal touch and create a visually appealing user interface.

Delve into the implementation of adding padding to the bottom navigation bar.
We carefully adjust the spacing to ensure a comfortable and aesthetically balanced layout.

## Key concepts

The main objective of this project is to explore various key concepts that
contribute to smooth page navigation and a layout that visually standout.
The focus is on the following key concepts:

**1. Page Navigation:** Learn how to navigate seamlessly across different pages within the app,
providing users with a smooth and intuitive user experience.
**2. Navigation Bar:** Control the navigation using a CupertinoTabBar, delegating page transitions
and control to an external widget, ensuring efficient and user-friendly navigation.
**2. Custom Fonts and Typography:** Utilizing the versatile 'Montserrat' font family, the pages
incorporate different weights, ranging from light to extra-bold.
This choice creates visually appealing typography.
**3. Padding:** Implement padding for the bottom navigation bar to achieve a refined and
aesthetically pleasing layout, ensuring optimal spacing and visual balance throughout the app.

## Assets

Here is brief information about the assets used:
- Font style: 'Montserrat' is utilized in this project, along with various weights, as seen below.
- Font weights: The available font weights include extra-light, light, medium, semi-bold, bold, and
